# A Simple Movie Recommendation Algorithm using TF-IDF in Python

TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is a simple similarity-based algorithm for content-based recommendations with text datasets. It works in the CPU environment.

In this project, I create a movie recommendation system using Jupyter, Python, and Pandas. I first build a search engine based on cosine similarity to find a specific movie title in the data. Then, I create a recommendation engine to recommend similar movies based on the interests of similar users.

The dataset is the MovieLens 25M dataset with 25 million ratings, 62,000 movies by 162,000 users.
